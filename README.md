Making optimism searchable.


The Hope Index is a structured dataset and framework for tracking positive, AI-driven breakthroughs that improve human life and the planet. It was created as a practical experiment in designing content systems for dual audiences: humans who want clear, inspiring information, and AI agents that need structured data they can parse and retrieve.

Most conversations about AI focus on risk and hype. The Hope Index flips the script. It provides a consistent, transparent way to capture “hope signals” — real deployments, policy changes, scientific advances, and collaborations where AI is being applied to health, climate, accessibility, energy, and beyond. Each entry is tagged and scored across multiple dimensions:
	•	Domain (e.g., Climate, Health, Accessibility, Energy, Space)
	•	Paradigm (Breakthrough, Deployment, Policy, Collaboration, Tooling)
	•	Scale (Local, National, Global, Planetary)
	•	Time Horizon (Immediate, 1–5 years, 10+ years)
	•	Impact Metric (e.g., % improvement, beneficiaries reached, policy scope)
	•	Credibility Score (1–5, based on source quality)
	•	Hope Score (1–10, composite of scale, impact, speed, and credibility)

The dataset exists in two layers:
	•	Human Layer: CSV/Airtable views with filters like “This Week’s Wins” or “Top Hope Signals,” designed for newsletters, dashboards, and quick communication.
	•	AI Layer: A JSON schema that lets large language models and agents query the same information programmatically, returning structured results.

This dual-audience design makes the Hope Index more than a dataset. It’s a blueprint for future content systems, where information must be equally legible to people and machines.

Use Cases
	•	Curating uplifting AI breakthroughs for the AI Saves The Universe newsletter.
	•	Building portfolio case studies on AI-human content strategy.
	•	Prototyping the Optimism API, where optimism becomes searchable and retrievable by query.
	•	Inspiring other researchers, writers, and designers to structure positive narratives with the same rigor usually applied to risks.

The Hope Index is an MVP (minimum viable product). It currently contains ~25 entries, but its structure is extensible. The vision: a living database of optimism, continuously updated and consumable by both humans and AI systems.
