## Overview

The **Hope Index** is a structured dataset and framework for tracking positive, AI-driven breakthroughs that improve human life and the planet.  

It was created as a practical experiment in designing content systems for **dual audiences**:  
- **Humans** who want clear, inspiring information.  
- **AI agents** that need structured data they can parse and retrieve.  

The dataset is stored as CSV/JSON, aligned with a schema that allows both people and machines to filter, analyze, and learn from it.

## Schema (v0.2)

Each row in the Hope Index represents a single development, tagged and scored for credibility, speed, scale, and impact.

## Hope Score Formula

Hope Score is derived from four sub-scores:

hope_score = ROUND(
  0.3*scale_score +
  0.3*impact_score +
  0.2*speed_score +
  0.2*credibility_norm
)

Where:
	‚Ä¢	scale_score: Local=3, National=6, Global=9, Planetary=10
	‚Ä¢	impact_score: 3/5/7/9/10, based on improvement magnitude/systemic shift
	‚Ä¢	speed_score: Immediate=10, 1-5y=6, 10+y=3
	‚Ä¢	credibility_norm: credibility_score √ó 2, +1 if verified_sources_count ‚â•2 (capped at 10)

Example (DARPA Wildfire Testbed)
	‚Ä¢	scale_score = 3 (National)
	‚Ä¢	impact_score = 3
	‚Ä¢	speed_score = 6 (1-5y horizon)
	‚Ä¢	credibility_score = 5 ‚Üí credibility_norm = 10
	‚Ä¢	hope_score = 4

‚∏ª

Implementation Notes
	‚Ä¢	The repo includes both manual scoring fields (impact_score, scale_score, etc.) and a calculated hope_score.
	‚Ä¢	In Numbers/Excel/Sheets, the calculation uses:
=ROUND(0.3*N2 + 0.3*L2 + 0.2*M2 + 0.2*MIN(O2*2 + IF(T2>=2,1,0),10),0)

Where:
	‚Ä¢	L = impact_score
	‚Ä¢	M = speed_score
	‚Ä¢	N = scale_score
	‚Ä¢	O = credibility_score
	‚Ä¢	T = verified_sources_count
	‚Ä¢	Some categories (e.g., pure economic damage reports) are tracked but not scored, since they don‚Äôt represent a forward-looking breakthrough.

Wildfire Vertical (Worked Example)

To demonstrate the schema in practice, the repo includes hope_index_wildfire_full.csv.

This sub-dataset captures AI-driven wildfire detection, prevention, and response systems ‚Äî DARPA helicopters, Google FireSat, ECMWF ML forecasts, Indigenous AI fire management, etc.

It acts as a calibration domain for the broader Hope Index.

Status
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Schema v0.2 defined
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Wildfire vertical populated (10+ entries)
	‚Ä¢	‚è≥ Expanding to additional domains (Health, Accessibility, Energy, Space)

## Scoring Calibration Anchors

To keep the Hope Score consistent across domains, the repo includes a set of calibration anchors.  
These are reference examples that define what a **3, 5, 7, and 9** should look like in practice.

| Score | Anchor Example | Why |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| **3** | **DARPA Wildfire Testbed** ‚Äî $59.8M pilot program, autonomous helicopters (National scale, medium certainty) | Early-stage, national-only, pilot not yet deployed |
| **5** | **ECMWF Wildfire Forecasting** ‚Äî ML extends prediction to 10 days (Global, deployed, moderate impact) | Clear improvement, already deployed, credible global org |
| **7** | **Pano AI Coverage** ‚Äî Startup system deployed across 30M acres, 100K fires detected (National scale, proven deployment) | Significant real-world scale and adoption, though not global |
| **9** | **Google FireSat** ‚Äî 5x5m global detection satellites, validated with live images (Global scale, high funding, deployed) | Systemic global infrastructure with measurable results |
| **10** | Reserved for **systemic shifts** (e.g., universal vaccines, grid-scale climate breakthroughs, AI-driven accessibility transformation) | Transformational, planetary-level change |

**Notes:**
- **Scale, impact, speed, credibility** all matter ‚Äî but the anchors prevent grade inflation.  
- **10** is deliberately rare. It should be a generational breakthrough.  
- **Economic reports** (e.g., wildfire costs) are not scored, but provide important context.  
- This calibration will evolve as more domains (Health, Accessibility, Energy, Space) are added.
